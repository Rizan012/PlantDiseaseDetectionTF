# üåø Plant Disease Detection System using TensorFlow and Streamlit

A deep learning-based web app that identifies plant leaf diseases using images. Built with **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit**, it helps detect 38 types of plant diseases and healthy conditions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to assist farmers, researchers, and gardeners in identifying plant diseases through image classification. It uses a custom-trained CNN on an augmented dataset of plant leaves.

---

## Model Architecture

The model is a deep CNN with the following structure:

- 5 convolutional blocks (filters: 32 ‚Üí 512)
- MaxPooling2D after every 2 conv layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Dense layers:
  - Fully connected (1500 units)
  - Softmax output for 38 categories

### Performance:
Training Accuracy:    97.5% 
Validation Accuracy: 96.0% 

---

## Dataset

- Source: `New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)`
- Training images: 70,295  
- Validation images: 17,572  
- Total Classes: 38 (e.g., `Tomato___Late_blight`, `Apple___healthy`, etc.)

---

## Streamlit App Overview

The app allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf and instantly receive the predicted disease class.

## Setup & Run the App

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install dependencies** (recommended inside a virtual environment):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then in activated env run the following code in cmd,
```bash
